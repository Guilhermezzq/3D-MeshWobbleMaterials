# MeshWobbleMaterial
In this code snippet, we're using the `MeshWobbleMaterial` component from the Three.js library to apply a jelly-like material to a 3D mesh. This type of material is useful for creating interesting visual effects on 3D objects, giving them a deformable and organic appearance.

The `MeshWobbleMaterial` allows adjusting various properties to control the appearance and behavior of the material:

- `color`: This property sets the color of the material. In the provided example, we're using 'skyblue' as the color.

- `factor`: Controls the intensity of the mesh deformation. The higher the value, the more pronounced the deformation. In the provided code, we're setting the factor to 3, resulting in a more visible deformation.

- `speed`: This property determines the speed at which the mesh oscillates. A higher value will result in faster oscillation. In the example, the value is set to 0.4, determining a moderate oscillation.

By adjusting these properties, it's possible to create a variety of jelly-like effects on 3D objects, adding dynamism and visual interest to your scenes.
